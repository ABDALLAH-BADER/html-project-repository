    <p>5. Conclusions
        The volume of data increases dramatically over time, especially data generated on the
        global pandemic caused by COVID-19. Such volume of data requires utilizing big data
        analytics tools along with AI techniques to make sense of the pandemic and control its
        spread in a timely manner. In this study, we presented a review of several data analysis
        applications for COVID-19, providing a taxonomy structure which classified the potential
        applications of COVID-19 into four categories, namely diagnosis, estimate or predict risk
        score, healthcare decision-making, and pharmaceutical. The paper introduced several data
        analysis tools and explained the main features of each tool. We also provided important
        insights on a number of challenges that might hinder the use of data analytics tools for
        COVID-19. These challenges include healthcare data security and patient privacy issues,
        the difficulty of sharing data with researchers, absence of data validation for some studies
        that may lead to biased results, and the patients’ cooperation in sharing part of their
        medical information. Finally, we highlighted and discussed a number of future directions
        that should be considered in further research and applications to assist stakeholders, such
        as governments, MoHs, hospitals, patients, and responsible authorities, to make decisions
        and predict the future.
