    <h1>Big Data Analytics Tools</h1>


    <p>Enterprise systems that have functions and functionality for big data applications are
        known as big data analytics platforms. It helps companies to reveal previously overlooked
        correlations, market trends, and valuable information from a large amount of big data.
        Tables 3 and 4 show the most popular big data analytics platforms and data storage
        management, respectively.</p>

    <p>4. Findings, Challenges, and Future Directions
        This section is organized as follows. First, Section 4.1 provides our findings from
        the literature review conducted in Section 2. Section 4.2 discusses the key challenges
        that were faced when designing big data analytics solutions to address the COVID-19
        pandemic. Section 4.3 presents several future directions to be considered by researchers
        and authorities.
        4.1. Findings
        This section is organized as follows. First, Section 4.1.1 introduces the type and source
        of data that can be used in healthcare solutions. Then, Section 4.1.2 introduces the type and
        source of COVID-19 data found in the literature.</p>
